## What it does?

The app scans your registry for all devices that seem to be a mouse. Then the app changes every device with a scroll wheel setting to use inverted scrolling.

## History

The early days people only had a monitor, a keyboard and a mouse. Then someone invented the scroll wheel and added it to the mouse. People liked it and adopted it. When you moved the wheel towards yourself the content in the screen was scrolling upwards. When you moved the wheel away from yourself the content in the screen was scrolling downwards. Due to the fact that touchscreens have been invented, people switched the style they scroll intuitively to the opposite behaviour. Until this settings will be the default in all operating systems, you can use this little tool for Windows.
